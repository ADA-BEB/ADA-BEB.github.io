<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>After dusk time, the lack of sunlight makes it difficult to identify one&apos;s appearance. <a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/reprints/RP1253.html">Grogger and Ridgeway</a> develop a method called the Veil of Darkness to examine racial profiling in traffic stops. <a href="https://5harad.com/papers/100M-stops.pdf">Pierson et al.</a> extend Grogger and Ridgeway&apos;s research and implements the Veil of Darkness method to investigate racial disparities against blacks and Hispanic drivers in police stops across the United States.</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>In this research question, we change the perspective and examine whether there is a bias against drivers of different sexes. To achieve this, we use a simplified version of the &quot;Veil of Darkness&quot; method, which was initially developed for racial disparities. The method requires the dusk time of the day of the event. A delta time, which represents how many minutes have passed since dusk or how many minutes until it is dusk, must be calculated using the dusk time. If the delta time value is negative, e.g., -60, then the event occurred before dusk, i.e., during daylight. On the contrary, if the delta time value is positive, e.g., +30, then the event occurred after dusk, i.e., during the night.</p>

<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><strong>Disclaimer: In the four datasets we worked on, there were only two sexes: female and male.</strong></p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>We analyze police stop records per sex: female and male, and per state: Arizona, Connecticut, Washington, and Wisconsin. We compare their rates of being searched and found to have contraband. Besides, using the information, we perform these analyses before and after dusk time.</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>In the plots below, as suggested in the paper, we chose not to plot where the dusk delta is [-30, 0]. Pierson et al. state this time interval is neither dark nor light. The time interval is 30 minutes between sunset and dusk time.</p>

<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>We examine if a driver was searched after being stopped in a police stop in the plot below.</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>We observe that as we expect, the search rates of male drivers are always noticeably higher than that of female drivers, whether it is before or after dusk. This situation does not change much in other states.&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>In Arizona, however, we see a drastic increase in female drivers&apos; search rates and a drastic decrease in male drivers&apos; search rates. This change might happen either due to an act of discrimination or a problem with the data.</p>

</strong></p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>We examine if a driver was found to have any contraband after searching in a police stop.</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>Even though contraband rates have more different rates than search rates, we observe that male drivers&apos; search rates are always noticeably higher than female drivers. This situation does not change much in other states and whether it is before or after dusk.&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>In Washington and Connecticut, we see a slight trend in contraband rates for female drivers after dusk compared to what we observe in search rates. This change might represent discrimination against men, considering even though women were stopped and searched less than men, their contraband rate is quite close to men.</p>
