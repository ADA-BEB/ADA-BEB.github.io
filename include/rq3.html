<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>For this part we focussed on the data for stops Florida, statewide.
These stops ranged from january 2010 to december of 2018.
We also restricted our analysis to stops that occurred in the time of day it can already be dark on any day of the year. This allows us to compare stop rates while accounting for driver behaviour that depends the time of day.</p>

<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>For these stops we performed a veil of darkness test.
Like in our previous research question, we visualised if there is a difference in gender proportions of stops before and after dusk.</p>

<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>We cannot really see any significant difference. We then performed a simple statistical veil of darkness test. With the test we attempt to explain which factors best predict whether a stopped driver is female. If it being dark means that the stopped driver is significantly less likely to be female, this can indicate that police officers discriminate against female drivers when it is not dark. From our test we find that women are slightly more likely to be stopped after dark, suggesting there might actually be a slight bias against men rather than women, but the results are not statistically significant (p-value = 0.067).</p>

<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>We then investigated if there is a difference between officers with different amounts of experience. We looked at 2 levels of experience: officers with 0-2 years of service, and officers with 3-10 years of service. We again compared the 2 groups visually by looking at stops conducted by officers from those groups.</p>

<div id="fl_exp"></div>

<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>Again we see no significant difference before and after dusk for either of the groups. We modified our statistical test to incorporate the amount of experience of the officer. However, we did not find a statistically significant difference (p-value = 0.413). Hence, we cannot conclude that officers with less experience are more sexist.</p>
